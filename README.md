# Next.js Module Federation CLI

This project is a CLI for easily creating Next.js applications with support for Module Federation. With this CLI, you can quickly set up a new Next.js project and start developing your application with shared modules across different applications and together in the package we add the prettier,eslint,jest,react testing library.

## 🚀 Installation

You can either install the CLI locally on your machine or use it via `npm`(not implement yet). To install it locally, run the following command:
`npm link` This will create a symbolic link to your project.

## 🎮 Usage

To create a new Next.js project with Module Federation support, run the following command:

```bash
create-nextjs-mf-cli your-project-name
```

This will create a new directory called your-project-name with the basic Next.js structure and the necessary configuration for using Module Federation.
